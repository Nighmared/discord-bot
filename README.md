# discord-bot
A discord-bot with some useful-ish features, most methods are kinda okayish commented but theres no actual docs;
Running the bot requires a DB that isnt currently tracked by the git repo, hmu if u actually want to run it and need a db scheme lol, additionally theres
- a file "PREFIX.txt" that contains ONE symbol used as the bots command prefix
- a file ".token.txt" with the discord token
- a file ".imgflip_creds.txt" containing credentials to imgflip in order to use the api for meme generation [format: username;password]
